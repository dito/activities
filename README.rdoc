= Introduction

activities is a gem that enables social activities in ActiveRecord objects.

= Install

  sudo gem install activities

You have to create a migration.

* Rails 2: <tt>script/generate migration create_activities</tt>
* Rails 3: <tt>rails generate migration create_activities</tt>

Then paste the following code.

  class CreateActivities < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :activities do |t|
        t.references :tracker, :polymorphic => true, :null => false
        t.references :trackable, :polymorphic => true, :null => false
        t.string :action, :null => false
        t.text :data, :null => true
        t.timestamps
      end

      add_index :activities, [:tracker_id, :trackable_id]
      add_index :activities, [:tracker_id, :trackable_id, :action]
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :activities
    end
  end

= Usage

Activities is plugged on associations. So, all you have to do is add something like this:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :projects
    activities_for :projects do
      track :renamed, :if => proc {|r| !r.new_record? && r.name_changed? }, :on => :save
      track :create
      track :update
      track :destroy
    end
  end

This will add activities when you create, update, destroy a project or the change its name.

To retrieve the activities, you can use the association +activities+.

  @user.activities.all

By default, all attributes are stored in a field called +data+. You should overwrite the method
+to_activity+ and return a hash with the attributes that you really want to be saved.

  class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :user

    def to_activity
      { :name => name, :status => status }
    end
  end

To display the activities, you should use the helper +render_activity+.

  <% for activity in @activities %>
    <%= render_activity @activity %>
  <% end %>

The +render_activity+ helper will render a partial as <tt>app/views/activities/TRACKABLE_TYPE/ACTION</tt>.
So, if you want to render activities for that project, you should create the following files:

  app/views/activities/project/_renamed.html.erb
  app/views/activities/project/_create.html.erb
  app/views/activities/project/_update.html.erb
  app/views/activities/project/_destroy.html.erb

The activity object will be available and you can display something like this:

  <p>
    <%= tracker.name %> created the
    repository <%= link_to data[:name], project_path(trackable) %>
    <%= time_ago_in_words data[:created_at] %>
  </p>
